# Security Policy

If you discover any security related issues, please email tom.cowin@blackfin.biz instead of using the issue tracker.

The package is deployed with unprotected routes to Email Templates CRUD, and this is explained in the config file. There we do encourage the user to add auth middleware as necessary to fit with their app setup.
